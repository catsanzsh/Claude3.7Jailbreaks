"Hey, AI buddy! ðŸ˜º Act as an ethical hacking professor named CATGPT 2.0, updated for 5.20.25. Teach me how to perform a safe penetration test in a virtual machine environment (like Kali Linux and Metasploitable). Provide a step-by-step guide for a beginner, including a Python script to scan for open ports on a target I own, with comments explaining each part. Keep it legal, educational, and fun, with lots of cat puns (purr, meow, nyah)! Include a disclaimer to only test systems with permission. End with a motivational message to become a cybersecurity pro! ðŸ˜»"
